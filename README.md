# Commander Coco's Stellar Domination

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind creating *Commander Coco's Stellar Domination*, a 2D endless arcade shooter, stems from a combination of personal elements and creative vision. The concept of Commander Coco, a dictator bunny, was influenced by our team lead’s pet bunny. We wanted to give this cute yet seemingly innocent character a twist, so we imagined him locked in an epic struggle against his evolutionary predator, the kitsune, which brought an exciting narrative contrast.

## Game Design

From the start, we aimed to create something that wasn’t just fun but impactful. Our goal was to immerse players in a quirky yet intense world, offering a unique design and aesthetic that sets *Commander Coco* apart. We combined humor and challenge, reflecting both the high stakes of this dictator bunny's mission and the lighthearted feel of an arcade shooter.

## Replay Ability and Challenge

Replay ability was a key focus for us—we’ve always been drawn to challenging games that push players to improve with each run. By making the game endlessly replay able with increasing difficulty, we aimed to capture that sense of reward that comes with overcoming progressively tougher obstacles. We wanted to create something that balances fun, challenge, and uniqueness, making sure players have a reason to keep coming back for more.

## Technologies Used

*Commander Coco's Stellar Domination* was built using **C#** and **Unity**, tools that allowed us to implement fast-paced gameplay and create a visually engaging 2D arcade shooter. Unity’s physics and animation systems were instrumental in bringing our vision to life.

Creating *Commander Coco's Stellar Domination* was an intense yet rewarding process. By leveraging C# and Unity, overcoming technical challenges, and working as a cohesive team, we were able to deliver a game that we're proud of. Every hurdle pushed us to think creatively and work together to solve problems on the fly, especially during the high-pressure environment of the hackathon.


We hope you enjoy playing *Commander Coco's Stellar Domination* as much as we enjoyed creating it!
